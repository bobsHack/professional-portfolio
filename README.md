## 🎯 How to Use professional-portfolio

### Open the App

Once installed, open the app by clicking its icon on your desktop or in your applications folder. The app will load your portfolio in a web interface.

### Update Your Information

Your portfolio is powered by a simple list of details:

- Your name and contact info
- Your work and education history
- Your skills and tools you know
- Your projects with descriptions and links

You can update these details by editing a file inside the app’s folder, typically a `portfolio.json` file. For basic users, the app might include an editor interface to make changes without text editing. If you want to edit manually:

1. Open the `portfolio.json` file in a plain text editor.
2. Change the text in quotes to match your information.
3. Save the file.
4. Refresh the app to see your changes.

If you find this difficult, ask a friend or use free online guides on editing text files.

### Share Your Portfolio

The portfolio runs as a single-page application that can be shared by sending a link or hosting it online. The app includes an option to publish your site with one click to GitHub Pages, a free website hosting service if you use GitHub.
